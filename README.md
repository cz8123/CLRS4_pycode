This folder contains Python implementations of the algorithms in
Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth edition, by Thomas H. Cormen,
Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.  The
Python code was written by Linda Xiao and Tom Cormen.

This Python code is provided for your reference.  We wrote it to match
the pseudocode in the book closely, but we have also varied from the
implementation in the book as we saw fit.  This Python code has been
minimally tested.  If you plan to use it in your own codebase, you
should test it further and observe the MIT License included in each
Python file within this folder.
